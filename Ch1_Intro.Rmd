### I'm using and testing an R Markdown document as a way of capturing my notes for this course

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
loading the library
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
```

# Chapter 1 Introduction
Just playing around here w/ R Markdown and code chunks
I'm going to try and use the tidyverse package where I can. 

```{r}
data <- tibble(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))
data %>% 
ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "red")
```

# Chapter 2 Applied 
Read in College data from ISLR package

## Problem 8.a & b
```{r}
# Reading the College data set as a tibble
data("College")
my_college <- as.tibble(College)
my_college
```

## Problem 8.c.i
```{r}
# looking at summary stats for the variables
my_college %>% 
  summary()
```

## Problem 8.c.ii
```{r}
# some plots
my_college[1:10] %>% 
  pairs()
```

## Problem 8.c.iii
```{r}
# boxplot of Outstate foe Privata vs Public school
my_college %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Private, y = Outstate)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Problem 8.c.iv
```{r}
# Creating a new variable "Elite" if more that 50% of their admissions were in the top 10 %
# I'm creating Elite as a logical not a factor
my_college <- my_college %>% 
  mutate(Elite = if_else(Top10perc > 50, TRUE , FALSE))
```
```{r}
my_college %>% 
  summarise(num_Elite = sum(Elite), num_not_Elite = sum(!Elite), prop_Elite = mean(Elite), prop_not_Elite = mean(!Elite))
```
```{r}
# creating a boxplot of Outstata for Elite vs non-Elite schools using "stat_boxplot"
my_college %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Elite, Outstate)) +
  stat_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# some histograms of various for 4 variables
# going to use grid.arrange() in the gridExtra library
library(gridExtra)
```
```{r}
# making 2 histograms and 2 scatter plots
p1 <- my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Applications to Private Schools")

p2 <-  my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "No") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Applications to Public Schools")

p3 <- my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps, Accept)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Applications vs Accepts for Private Schools")

p4 <- my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "No") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps, Accept)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Applications vs Accepts for Public Schools")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2)

```
