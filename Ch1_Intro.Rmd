### I'm using and testing an R Markdown document as a way of capturing my notes for this course

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
loading the library
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
```

# Chapter 1 Introduction
Just playing around here w/ R Markdown and code chunks
I'm going to try and use the tidyverse package where I can. 

```{r}
data <- tibble(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))
data %>% 
ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "red")
```

# Chapter 2 Applied 
Read in College data from ISLR package

## Problem 8.a & b
```{r}
# Reading the College data set as a tibble
data("College")
my_college <- as.tibble(College)
my_college
```

## Problem 8.c.i
```{r}
# looking at summary stats for the variables
my_college %>% 
  summary()
```

## Problem 8.c.ii
```{r}
# some plots
my_college[1:10] %>% 
  pairs()
```

## Problem 8.c.iii
```{r}
# boxplot of Outstate for Privata vs Public school
my_college %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Private, y = Outstate)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Problem 8.c.iv
```{r}
# Creating a new variable "Elite" if more that 50% of their admissions were in the top 10 %
# I'm creating Elite as a logical not a factor
my_college <- my_college %>% 
  mutate(Elite = if_else(Top10perc > 50, TRUE , FALSE))
```
```{r}
my_college %>% 
  summarise(num_Elite = sum(Elite), num_not_Elite = sum(!Elite), prop_Elite = mean(Elite), prop_not_Elite = mean(!Elite))
```
```{r}
# creating a boxplot of Outstata for Elite vs non-Elite schools using "stat_boxplot"
my_college %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Elite, Outstate)) +
  stat_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# some histograms and scatter plots
# going to use grid.arrange() in the gridExtra library
library(gridExtra)
```
```{r}
# making 2 histograms and 2 scatter plots
p1 <- my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Applications to Private Schools")

p2 <-  my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "No") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Applications to Public Schools")

p3 <- my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps, Accept)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Applications vs Accepts for Private Schools")

p4 <- my_college %>% 
  filter(Private == "No") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Apps, Accept)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Applications vs Accepts for Public Schools")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2)

```

## Problem 9.a - 9.f
```{r}
# reading the Auto data set from the ISLR package and removing NAs
data("Auto")
my_auto <- as.tibble(drop_na(Auto))
my_auto
my_auto %>% 
  summary()
# select function in MASS can interfer with select function in dplyr. 
# Needed to explicitly call dplyr::select
table_out <- my_auto %>% 
  dplyr::select(-name) %>% 
   summarise_all(funs(min,max,mean,sd))
table_out
```
```{r}
# dropping rows 10 - 85 using a negative slice
# and re-running summary
my_auto %>% 
  slice(-(10:85)) %>% 
  summary()
```
```{r}
# selecting rows 100:max raw
x <- my_auto %>% nrow()
my_auto %>% 
  slice(100:x) %>% 
  summary()        
```
```{r}
# using the GGally package which is an add-on to ggplot to pairwise matrix plots. The progrees = FALSE supresses bars that indicate progress in
# producing the plots

```

```{r}
my_auto %>%
   dplyr::select(-name) %>% 
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```
```{r}
library(GGally)
```

## Problem 10.a - 10.h

```{r}
# loading the Boston data set from the MASS library and omitting NAs
data("Boston")
?Boston
my_boston <- as.tibble(drop_na(Boston))
glimpse(my_boston)
```
```{r}
# looking at some basic summary stats
my_boston %>% 
  summary()
```
```{r}
# doing pairwise plots using ggpairs
my_boston %>% 
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# filtering to find suburbs that bound the Charles River
my_boston %>% 
  filter(chas == 1) %>% 
  count()
```
```{r}
# median pupil-teacher ratio
my_boston %>% 
  dplyr::select(ptratio) %>% 
  summary()
```
```{r}
# lowest median value of owner occupied homes
lowest_median <- my_boston %>% 
  filter(medv == min(medv))
summary(lowest_median)
```

```{r}
# building some plot to compare crime in lowest_median to my_boston
# note that there are onlt 2 data point in lowest_median so not very interesing plots
lm_c <- lowest_median %>% 
  ggplot(aes(crim)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Crime Rate in Lowest Median Value")
lm_b <- lowest_median %>% 
  ggplot(aes(black)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Black propostion in Lowest Median Value")
lm_s <- lowest_median %>% 
  ggplot(aes(crim,black)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

grid.arrange(lm_c, lm_b, lm_s,nrow = 3)
```

```{r}
# using filter to find suburbs w/ more, on average, more than 7 rooms and more than eight room per
# dwelling
my_boston %>% 
  filter(rm  > 7) %>% 
  nrow()
my_boston %>% 
  filter(rm > 7) %>% 
  summary()
```
```{r}
my_boston %>% 
  filter(rm > 8) %>% 
  nrow()

my_boston %>% 
  filter(rm > 8) %>% 
  summary()
```
```{r}

```
