### I'm using and testing an R Markdown document as a way of capturing my notes for this course

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Chapter 1 Introduction
Just playing around here w/ R Markdown and code chunks

```{r}
data <- tibble(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))
data %>% 
ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "red")
```

# Chapter 2 Applied 
Read in College data from ISLR package

```{r}
# Reading the College data set as a tibble
data("College")
my_college <- as.tibble(College)
my_college
```

```{r}
# looking at summary stats for the variables
my_college %>% 
  summary()
```
```{r}
# some plots
my_college[1:10] %>% 
  pairs()
```

```{r}
# boxplot of Outstate foe Privata vs Public school
my_college %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Private, y = Outstate)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
