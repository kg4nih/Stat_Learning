## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Loading my standard work environment libraries and the ISLR library
library(MASS) # LDA package
library(class) # K-Nearest Neighbors package
library(glmnet) # Generalized Linear Models - LASSO and Ridge Regression
library(leaps) # best subset, FSS and BSS regression
library(broom)
library(gridExtra)
library(GGally)
library(knitr)
library(ISLR)
library(boot) # bootstrap and CV
library(car)
library(caret)
library(e1071)
library(tidyverse)
# note that dplyr select() is masked by MASS library. Need to use dplyr::select()
# my own function for calculating classification error
calc_class_err <- function(actual, predicted) {
  mean(actual != predicted)
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
