## Chapter 3 Linear Regression

My notes and worked examples for linear regression.

```{r}
# Loading my standard work environment libraries and the ISLR library
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(gridExtra)
library(GGally)
library(knitr)
library(ISLR)
```
## 3.6 Lab: Linear Regression

3.6.1 Libraries

```{r}
# ISLR is already laoded
# Loading MASS library
# Note that the MASS library may mess-up the dplry select() function
# I'm also practicing using tibbies, ggplot and the broom packages
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
# this was a recommended solution; define select to be the dplyr select() function
select <- dplyr::select
```

```{r}
# loading Boston data set
data(Boston)
attach(Boston)
```
```{r}
# creating first LM and playing w/ making it tidy
lm.fit <- Boston %>% 
  lm(medv~lstat, data = .)
# looking at the broom functions
tidy(lm.fit, conf.int = TRUE)

```

```{r}
augment(lm.fit)
```
```{r}
glance(lm.fit)
```
